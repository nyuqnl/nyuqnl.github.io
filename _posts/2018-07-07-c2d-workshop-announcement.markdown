Greetings rising high school juniors and seniors!

![c2d workshop]({{ "/assets/c2d.png" | absolute_url }})

In this world of vast technological advances and the growing use of artificial intelligence, the demand for capable engineers increases. But we can only produce the engineers of tomorrow if people want to become engineers!

NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering is offering you the chance to find out if you might be one of them.

High school students who are rising 11th and 12th graders can apply for our 8-day Creative Circuit Design workshop exploring the basics of electrical engineering and learning why engineers are important right now. With hands-on projects like configuring a potato battery to building working circuit boards, you’ll also be learning the science behind them. You do not need to be familiar with or have prior experience in electrical engineering: You’ll be led step by step through all of it.

The workshop will be held at NYU’s Tandon Campus in Downtown Brooklyn from August 10 through 17, every day from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. You will be joined by like-minded individuals who want to pursue engineering with a passion, and the workshop is **FREE**!

Supported by: [Shaloo Rakheja](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/shaloo-rakheja){:target="_blank"}, Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
