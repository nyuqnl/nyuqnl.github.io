We work in Quantum Nanoelectronics Lab (QNL) in the department of Electrical and Computer [Engineering](http://engineering.nyu.edu){:target="_blank"} at [NYU](https://nyu.edu){:target="_blank"}. 
Our work lies at the intersection of applied physics and electrical engineering. 
We are passionate about working on transformative research problems in nanoelectronics that will extend the boundaries of electrical engineering beyond its traditional information- and energy-processing domains.
